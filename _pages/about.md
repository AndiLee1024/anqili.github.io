About Me
======
I am Anqi Li, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University, located in Xi’an, Shaanxi, China. My research lies at the intersection of remote sensing, computational spectral imaging, image processing, computer vision, and deep learning. I am passionate about enabling machines to “see” and understand the world more intelligently — from reconstructing the invisible details hidden in spectral data to designing algorithms that bridge physics and perception. Beyond research, I enjoy exploring creative ways to make science more intuitive and technology more human.
